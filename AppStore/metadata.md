Big Rocks First is a beautifully simple task manager that stores your todos in a plain markdown file you control.

**Your Data, Your Way**
Unlike other todo apps that lock your data in proprietary formats, Big Rocks First uses simple markdown files. Your todos are always accessible, portable, and future-proof.

**Key Features**

• **Markdown-Based Storage** - Your todos live in a .md file you can open anywhere
• **Goals & Todos Side by Side** - Keep your big-picture goals visible while managing daily tasks
• **Smart Priority Levels** - Organize tasks by This Week, Urgent, and Normal priorities
• **Context Tags** - Use #prep, #reply, #deep and custom tags to categorize your work
• **Mind Map View** - Visualize your tasks in an interactive mind map
• **Quick Add** - Press Cmd+Shift+T to instantly capture tasks from your clipboard
• **Menu Bar Access** - Always one click away from adding a new task
• **AI Tag Suggestions** - Optional Claude AI integration to auto-suggest tags (requires API key)

**Perfect For**
- People who want control over their data
- Markdown and plain-text enthusiasts
- Anyone tired of complex project management tools
- GTD and productivity system users

**Privacy First**
Your todo file stays on your computer. The optional AI feature connects to Anthropic's API only when you explicitly request tag suggestions - your data is never stored or shared.

## App Review Notes

This app requires the user to select or create a markdown file on first launch. The file is stored wherever the user chooses (typically Documents folder).

The AI feature (tag suggestions) is optional and requires users to provide their own Anthropic API key in Settings. The app connects to api.anthropic.com only when the user explicitly requests suggestions.

Test Account: Not required - app works locally without any account.
